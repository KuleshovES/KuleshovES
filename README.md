## About me
I am a QA engineer with 5+ years of experience. Worked in large IT companies in Russia: Luxoft, Raiffeisenbank, Kaspersky, etc. I have good experience in testing (web, Rest API), as well as some experience in testing desktop and mobile applications. I am flexible and quickly join the team. I have experience working with Agile methodology (Scrum/Kanban). I am developing in the direction of test automation. I am taking java courses at Hyperskill. I currently live in Valencia and am looking for a job in Spain or remotely.
